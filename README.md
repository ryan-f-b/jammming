# Jammming

Jammming is a React web application that allows users to search for songs on Spotify, create custom playlists, and save them directly to their Spotify account. This project was built using **React** and **Vite**, with full integration of the Spotify Web API using the **Authorization Code with PKCE** flow.

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**  
   The app uses Spotify’s Authorization Code with PKCE flow to securely access a user’s account. Tokens are stored in localStorage and automatically refreshed when expired.

2. **Searching Tracks**  
   Enter a search term in the search bar. The app queries Spotify’s `/v1/search?type=track` endpoint and displays results including song name, artist, album, and a “+” button to add tracks.

3. **Creating a Playlist**  
   - Add tracks from the search results.
   - Enter a playlist name.
   - Click “Save to Spotify” to create the playlist in your Spotify account.
   - Feedback messages show progress or errors (e.g., missing name or tracks).

4. **Managing Tracks**  
   - Tracks can be removed using the “-” button.
   - Playlists can be renamed by typing directly into the playlist name field.
